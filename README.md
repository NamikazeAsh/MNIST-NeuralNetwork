# MNIST Neural Network Project

Welcome to the MNIST Neural Network Project! This project demonstrates the power of deep learning by training a neural network on the famous MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a neural network capable of classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. By training the model on thousands of images, the neural network learns to distinguish between the digits 0-9. This project explores various deep learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale, corresponding to one of the digits 0-9.

## Model Architecture
The neural network in this project is a simple yet effective architecture designed for image classification tasks:

- **Input Layer:** 28x28 pixel images flattened into a 784-dimensional vector.
- **Hidden Layers:** A fully connected network with two hidden layers of varying sizes.
- **Output Layer:** A 10-unit output layer corresponding to the 10 digits, with a softmax activation function for classification.

### Activation Functions:
- **ReLU** for the hidden layers
- **Softmax** for the output layer

### Loss Function:
- **Cross-entropy loss** for multi-class classification

### Optimizer:
- **Adam optimizer** for efficient training

## Performance Evaluation
Performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy** on the test set
- **Confusion Matrix** for identifying misclassifications
- **Visualizing Predictions** for individual test samples

The model's performance can be improved with hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and other optimization techniques.

### Sample Visualizations:
- Visualizations of predictions compared to true labels
- Misclassified samples with predictions and true labels

### Tech Stack:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: 
    - TensorFlow/Keras
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
